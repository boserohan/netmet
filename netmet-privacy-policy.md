# Extension Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

User data collected and stored explicitly from users using the NetMet chrome extension:
1. IP Address
2. City

## Chrome Storage API

NetMet takes advantage of [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to locally store minimal state information. This is similar to a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies). Google syncs this information across your various computers and Chrome installations. However, NetMet only accesses this data locally on your machine and does not transmit it. 

## Third-Party APIs

NetMet accesses third party APIs and reports back the results. For example, when a speed test is being performed in NetMet, it is connecting to the M-Lab servers. M-Lab stores data related to the speed test and other connection parameters in accordance with their own privacy policy. Generally, when Netmet uses these third Party API services, it might send some non-personal information about the page you are visiting. However, when extensions access a third party API, there is some personal information that third party receives in the [request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header), most notably your [IP address](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/what-is-an-ip-address.htm) and [user agent string](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/user-agent). Some companies will use information like that to develop a â€œ[browser fingerprint](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)" that can probably track and personally identify you. Unfortunately, this is not something that NetMet has control over. If this is a concern for you, please stop using the extension immediately.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are substantive<sup>1</sup> changes made to this blanket privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of any of my extensions, we will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:rohan.bose@tum.de) or [file an issue]((https://github.com/boserohan91/netmet/issues)) to this repository.

#### Notes:
1 - When we say "substantive," we mean that we won't push out app updates for minor changes like fixing a typo.
